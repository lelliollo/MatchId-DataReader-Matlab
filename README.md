# MatchId-DataReader-Matlab
Matlab class to read the .csv matrix output generated  by the Digital Image Correlation (DIC) software MatchId <https://www.matchidmbc.be/>.

Copyright - 2018 - Alberto Lavatelli <alberto.lavatelli@polimi.it> 

This Matlab class is designed to make it easier for people to load and process MatchID data into their Matlab application.
In no way this is intended as a product of the MatchID company, although I am lucky enough to have worked with the software developers for research activity. This product, instead, comes from my need to process DIC data with Matlab. What you find here is simply a code module that served me a lot and worked for my projects.
As for today, this software doesn't contain documentation, but it is foreseen in the nearby future. (Together with a broader Matlab/MatchId interface).

If you have any question, feel free to contact me via e-mail.
